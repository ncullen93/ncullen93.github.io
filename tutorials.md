# Tutorials

On this page, we present a comprehensive collection of tutorials for learning how
to use various tools in the ANTsX ecosystem. Some tutorials are short and demonstrate 
specific functions at a glance, whereas other tutorials are more in-depth and cover
a broad functionality. If there's something specific you'd like to learn about, feel
free to ask us to make a tutorial for it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Comprehensive ANTs Tutorial

This is the main ANTs tutorial with which everyone should start. This 41-page guide gives
a short overview of the methodology and software behind ANTs using real examples. 
The tutorial can be downloaded here [as a pdf](https://github.com/stnava/ANTsDoc/raw/master/ants2.pdf).

### Cooking up template priors

This short tutorial gives you code and a collection of real brian images to demonstrate
how to make template priors. The code and data 
[can be found on github](https://github.com/ntustison/antsCookTemplatePriorsExample)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Pediatric Template of Brain Perfusion

This tutorial uses ANTs and ANTsR to show you how to process raw pediatric MRI
data with the following goals:

- Organize and inspect the raw data and identify potential problem cases.
- Develop a template construction procedure to address our hypotheses.
- Attach prior distributions to the template.
- Process the full data with ANTs pipelines.
- Perform univariate and multivariate statistical tests.

The complete code and data [can be found on github](https://github.com/stnava/ANTsTutorial)

### Basic Brain Mapping

This short tutorial demonstrates a simple and fast brain registration example. Also,
this tutorial shows how to use a brain mask to restrict the registration focus.
