# Scientific literature behind the ANTsX ecosystem

ANTs-based tools have been both described and applied in many peer-reviewed 
scientific papers.

----------------------------------------------------------------
## Theory & Applications
<br/>
The peer-reviewed papers in this section describe and validate specific tools in 
the ANTsX ecosystem (theory), or have applied ANTs-based tools for processing or analyzing 
medical images as part of a scientific study (applications).

- <a href="/literature-theory/" style="font-size:26px">Theory Literature</a>
- <a href="/literature-applications/" style="font-size:26px">Applications Literature</a>

----------------------------------------------------------------

## ANTs & Medical Imaging
<br/>
The peer-reviewed papers and ideas presented in this section place ANTs-based tools in 
the context of the broader medical imaging literature and thus do not necessarily describe or even
use ANTs-based tools specifically.

- <a href="/literature-segmentation/" style="font-size:26px">Segmentation Literature</a>
- <a href="/literature-multianalysis/" style="font-size:26px">Multivariate Analysis Literature</a>

----------------------------------------------------------------

## ANTs & Disorders
<br/>
The peer-reviewed papers in this section have validated the performance of ANTs-based tools 
in the context of subjects with specific disorders, or have used ANTs-based tools 
to investigate scientific hypothesis related to specific disorders.

- <a href="/literature-depression/" style="font-size:26px">Depression & Anxiety Literature</a>
- <a href="/literature-tbi/" style="font-size:26px">Traumatic Brain Injury Literature</a>

## ANTs & Other Communities
<br/>
The ANTs ecosystem is most prevalently found in the brain imaging literature, but has found
success in other communities as well. Here, we present a few of the other communities in which
ANTs-based tools are commonly used.
