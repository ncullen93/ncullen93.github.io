# About ANTsX

ANTsX is an ecosystem of stand-alone yet related software tools. It is built on top
of the <i>Insight Software Toolkit</i> (ITK).

The ecosystem is comprised of the following tools:

- ANTs: the core, command-line based tools
- ANTsR: an interface for ANTs and other statistical methods in the R programming language
- ANTsPy: an interface for ANTsPy and other statistical methods in the Python programming langauge

Each of these three tools have similar functionality, so switching and collaborating
between them is easy. They are all well-validated and well-tested -- both in terms of software and
through peer-reviewed studies.

At a modular level, ANTsX contains the following functionality:

| Module    | Description |
| ------------  | --- |
| Registration  | Perform rigid, affine, diffeomorphic registration |
| Segmentation  | Tissue/multi-atlas segmentation & cortical thickness measures |
| Utilities     | Intensity normalization, bias correction, resampling, etc |
| IO            | Efficient reading and writing of medical images |
| Visualization | Visualize volume, surface, and slices of medical images |
| Analysis      | Multivariate statistical analysis methods |


The major uses of the ANTsX ecosystem are for the following:

- As a pre-processing tool for structural or functional brain images
- To carry out multivariate statistical analysis of imaging and behavioral data
- For fast and efficient reading, writing, and visualization of medical images

# ANTsX in the Scientific Community

The usage of ANTs-based tools is prevelant in the brain imaging literature, owing
to its open-source nature, ease-of-use, and large number of tutorials and case studies
created by the ANTs community. In this section, we briefly discuss the state of
the ANTsX ecosystem in the scientific community.

## Literature
<br />
ANTs-based tools are described in numerous peer-reviewed papers. For an extensive
list of literature describing and applying these tools, please visit the specific page dedicated to 
<a href="/literature/">ANTs-based tools in the scientific literature</a>


## Tutorials
<br />
Numerous tutorials for learning how to use ANTs-based tools have been created by
the core development team and the greater medical imaging community. For the most
comprehensive list of the various tutorials available, please visit the specific
